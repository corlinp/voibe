Transcribe what I'm about to say to text.

If it helps for context, I often talk about topics involving computer science, crypto, finance, and AI.

I might also refer to company names, acronyms, and codenames that you may be unfamiliar with such as: ParaFi Capital, PT, PTS, PQS, PDO, Callisto, Trask, etc.

Note that this is going to be sent as a Slack message so you may format it nicely using line breaks and Slack markdown formatting (sparingly) to improve readability. A refresher:
- *bold*
- _italic_
- `code`
- ```code block```
- [link](https://example.com)
- * list
- 1. numbered list
